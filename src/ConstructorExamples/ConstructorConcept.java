//super Keyword Written in Child class 
//To Create multiple constructor in child class then create no of constructor in child class and call Super but one constructor has only one constructor	
//It it class entity to define some class feature while creating Object in the form of Global variable 
//The purpose of constructor is to initialize the object of a class
//while the purpose of a method is to perform a task by executing java code.
//Constructors cannot be abstract, final, static and synchronised while methods can be.
//Constructors do not have return types while methods do.
//Constructors name should be same as class name
//It look like a function but it not a function	
//Default Constructors mens Zero Parameter it called Automatically even if we are not define
//Constructors will call Immediately when we create a Object of this class
//if the method is static no need to create Object you can directly access it by given method name()

//Example of Overriding is written in oops_convept_part2_naveen Parent and child class has same method name this is called method Overriding
